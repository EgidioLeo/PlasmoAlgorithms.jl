# PlasmoAlgorithms
PlasmoAlgorithms is a collection of decomposition algorithms to solve mathematical programming models taking [Plasmo](https://github.com/jalving/Plasmo.jl) graphs as input. Plasmo graphs allow to create graphs of models, in which each node represents a model, and the arcs represent linking constraints. Several hierarchical problems can be expressed in this way, for example: supply chain planning and scheduling, optimization of power systems, and stochastic programming problems.
